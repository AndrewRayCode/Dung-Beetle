Overview:
Dung Beetle is a Firebug knockoff designed to give powerful cross browser
CSS and JavaScript inspecting / debugging / editing capabilities. This is
a long overdue niche that I am attempting to fill. Firebug Lite is broken
and unusuable, Opera Dragonfly frankly sucks, and IE has nothing. Dung
Beetle works in ALL of those browsers. Want to edit your CSS in IE6? Dung
Beetle lets you do that exactly like Firebug does. Need console.log? No
problem, we've got it. And a whole host of other amazing features.

General Information: 
- There is no simple way CURRENTLY to use this repository. The index.html
	code is coupled with the dung-beetle.js code. If you want to use it
	put everything from dung-core and html into the same folder and launch
	index.html. ALTERNATIVELY you can see this beast in action at:
	http://andrewray.me/dung-beetle/index.html 
- All of the magic is in dung-core/dung-beetle.js.
- The code is a disaster. Can you say polluted namespace?
- Refactoring next step: Convert this all to MooTool's graceful class
	structure.

Known Bugs:
- Opera does not display cursor styles - like resize cursor when over the 
	resize area of dung beetle
- Opera scrollbar covers button
- Re-inspecting loses cancelled classes and styles, need to save? (this is an old comment I wrote down, might need to investigate more)
- Comma separated CSS values are not found
- Selected element in DOM -> edit node of another -> DOM does not select new node
- IDs don't show up in DOM 
- IE img tag has no attributes
- IE makes border:0 into border-left,right, etc. Mapping for fix?
- curent_element is null if edit DOM node right out of the box (?)

Things to implement:
- up / down keyboard arrow pixel nudging, like firebug does
- minimize button
